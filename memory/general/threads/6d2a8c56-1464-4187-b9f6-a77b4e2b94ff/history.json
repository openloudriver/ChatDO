Enabled architectural freedom for mission teams under pre-configured AF IC cybersecurity guardrails, radically accelerating warfighter speed, cloud adoption, and operational scaling.\nMetrics: •\t$8.742M/year Azure engineering labor (30 FTE contractors) \t•\t$844K/year Azure hub cloud infrastructure \t•\t3 security domains: Unclassified, SIPR, JWICS \t•\tFounding stakeholders: Space Force, CENTCOM \t•\tMission partners: SOCOM, AFOTEC, ACC A3/2D \t•\tIndustry partner: Microsoft Azure \t•\tATO timeline: 8 months (record), 3-year duration \t•\tProgram Status: Fully transitioned to DAF CLOUDworks Program of Record \t•\tOperational: Yes (active production use)\nNotes: This was the first instance of a single, enterprise-scale, inheritable Azure ATO in the Air Force IC with continuous monitoring enabled at Day 1. Built without central funding—entirely sustained through external customer investment. The solution permanently removed ATO as the pacing item for classified cloud onboarding and enabled mission-driven, not architecture-restricted, development.\n\nReturn exactly three bullets, each <= 215 characters.\n\nBullet mode: \"Award (215)\" (target: 215 chars).\nAlways keep suggestions within the character limit for the selected mode.\n\nIMPORTANT: Each bullet option MUST start with \"- \" (dash followed by space).

Scene Setting:\n\n- What major contract vehicles is the DAF using for cloud procurement (to include, I believe, JWCC and Cloud One)? DAF Cw utilizing C2E.  We do have three Mission partners who have utilized JWCC for their own Cloud Capacity, managed by themselves.\n\n- What is the relative size of these contracts (workloads, cost, programs supported, etc.)? Vary greatly on specific demand.  It is all based on cloud consumption and Professional Services (labor) estimates ranging up to $20M dollars. DAF Cw utilizes and supports many C2E task orders a year. \n\n- Is the scope of these contracts different? If so, how? I believe the only different between JWCC and C2E from a scope perspective is one is for the IC (C2E) and one if for the DoW (JWCC)\n\n- How has the DAF decided between which contract vehicle to use? We are in the IC, we only utilize C2E.  Again, several Mission Partners do utilize JWCC, and they are associated with DoW.\n\n \n\n2. Personnel:\n\n- How many personnel is the DAF dedicating to navigating cloud procurement and management? For managing our own C2E Task Orders, we have 6 .  DAF Cw has ~250 people that manage the enterprise cloud environment.\n\n- What is the delta in filled billets from Jan 2025 to present day for these cloud procurement offices? DAF Cw would welcome any additional billets to support the expansion of the program.  I do not know how many billets are associated specifically to DAF Cw, I would lean on your knowledge as Andrew may be the only one to answer that.\n\n \n\n3.
