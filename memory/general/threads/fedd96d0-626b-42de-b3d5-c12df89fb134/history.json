      "title": "Tucker Carlson vs The Church: The Secret Israel Agenda They Hid from Believers!",
      "siteName": "Video",
      "published": null,
      "summary": "Summary: The video argues that Tucker Carlson’s questioning of American evangelical support for Israel exposed a politically engineered alliance among Israel, U.S. politicians, and Christian leaders. It claims this alliance fueled a profitable “prophecy industry” and shaped church teaching and media messaging, often eclipsing scripture. The piece says Carlson’s critique prompted backlash from religious institutions but also sparked a broader reevaluation of prophecy, politics, and biblical interpretation. Key Points:",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Alleges the church’s pro-Israel stance was strategically cultivated to align Israeli interests, U.S. political needs, and evangelical influence, rather than stemming from a clear biblical mandate.",
        "Claims pastors, seminaries, and Christian media normalized Israel-centric eschatology and used fear and emotion as persuasive tools.",
        "Argues the New Testament does not command support for modern nation-states and that early Christian teaching emphasized the church as “spiritual Israel.”",
        "Describes a “billion-dollar” prophecy industry built on books, conferences, TV, and constant Middle East tension to sustain attention and donations.",
        "Reports strong institutional backlash against Carlson, alongside a purported “awakening” of believers seeking to disentangle faith from geopolitics."
      ],
      "whyMatters": "The video taps into ongoing debates within evangelicalism about Christian Zionism, media influence, and the politicization of theology. If these claims gain wider traction, they could shift church teaching, voter behavior, and funding patterns tied to prophecy and Middle East policy."
