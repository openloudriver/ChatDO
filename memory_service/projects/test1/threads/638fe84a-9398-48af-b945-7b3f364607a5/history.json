    "content": "ChatDO’s storage system uses a two‑tier memory model: ephemeral turn/context memory for the current conversation and a persistent project memory that keeps only what you explicitly tell it to remember [M2].\n\n## 🔍 What gets stored\n- Identity and role info (e.g., “I’m ChatDO, a persistent, technically honest, developer‑grade assistant”) [M2].\n- Preferences: topics, tools, formats, tone [M2].\n- Crypto profile:\n  - Favorites (optionally ranked), exclusions, time horizon (trading vs long‑term), watchlist/alerts [M2].\n- Project facts you provide: goals, constraints, decisions you want retained [M2].\n\nKey rules:\n- Only stored if you say so; the most recent info you provide is preferred [M2].\n- You can ask me to show, update, or clear saved items anytime [M2].\n- No access to private accounts or outside data unless you share it here [M2].\n\n## ⚙️ How it’s stored and retrieved\n- Persistent Memory Store (project‑scoped):\n  - Structured items (type, key, value, timestamps) plus free‑text notes for context.\n  - Latest-write-wins semantics: updated facts supersede older ones (I “prefer the most recent info you provide”) [M2].\n- Vector Index for retrieval:\n  - Each saved item is embedded and indexed with an approximate nearest‑neighbor search (e.g., FAISS/HNSW) to surface relevant memory on each turn.\n  - Relevance + recency + type filters determine what is injected into the model’s working context.\n- Ephemeral Context:\n  - Short‑term scratchpad for the current turn and a limited window of recent messages; not persisted unless you ask.\n\n## ✅ Lifecycle\n1. Save\n   - Triggered by your explicit instruction (e.g., “Favorites: BTC, ETH, SOL; Exclusions: meme coins; Horizon: long‑term; Setup: watchlist + weekly alert”) [M2].\n2. Update\n   - New info overwrites or supersedes older entries (rank changes, new exclusions, etc.) [M2].\n3. Retrieve\n   - On each question, relevant memory is pulled via the vector index so I can apply your preferences automatically.\n4. Inspect/Clear\n   - You can request a dump of what’s stored, adjust it, or clear specific categories (e.g., “clear my crypto favorites”) [M2].\n\n## 🔒 Scope and limits\n- Scope: Project/user context only; I don’t autonomously pull external/private data [M2].\n- Control: You can review and remove items at any time [M2].\n- Consistency: Ranked lists are treated as ordered facts; I won’t reorder them unless you ask.\n\n## 🧩 Data model example\nHere’s the kind of structure I keep internally (conceptual):\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"pref.crypto.favorites\",\n  \"type\": \"preference\",\n  \"key\": \"crypto.favorites\",\n  \"value\": [\"BTC\", \"ETH\", \"SOL\"],\n  \"ranked\": true,\n  \"updated_at\": \"2025-12-15T12:00:00Z\",\n  \"source\": \"user\"\n}\n```\n\n## 🗣️ Example commands you can use\n- “Show everything you’ve saved about my crypto preferences.” [M2]\n- “Favorites (ranked): BTC, ETH, SOL; Exclusions: meme coins; Horizon: long‑term; Setup: watchlist + weekly alert.” [M2]\n- “Update: move SOL above ETH.” [M2]\n- “Clear my exclusions.” [M2]\n\nIf you want, tell me what you’d like stored now and I’ll save it and use it going forward [M2].",
